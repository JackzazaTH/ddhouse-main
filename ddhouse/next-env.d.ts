// The triple-slash directives below were removed to resolve a build error
// where TypeScript could not find the type definition files for 'next'.
// In a correctly configured Next.js project with dependencies installed,
// these types should be picked up automatically by the TypeScript compiler
// from the node_modules directory.

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
